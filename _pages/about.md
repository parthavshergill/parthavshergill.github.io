# Hi, I'm Parthav Shergill

I'm a Member of Technical Staff at [Inflection AI](https://inflection.ai/), where I'm passionate about building the next generation of conversational AI systems. My work spans the full spectrum from distributed systems engineering to AI research, with a focus on creating more reliable and statistically rigorous approaches to AI development.

## What I'm Working On

Currently at Inflection AI, I'm tackling fundamental challenges in conversational AI from two angles:

- **Engineering**: Designing robust data systems for distributed LLM training pipelines, ensuring we can scale AI training efficiently and reliably
- **Research**: Developing statistically rigorous approaches to evaluating conversational intelligence in LLMs, moving beyond surface-level metrics to understand true AI capabilities
- **Multi-agent Architecture**: Building systems where multiple AI agents can collaborate effectively, including our [Inflection Insights](https://www.inflection.ai/insights) platform that enables natural dialog with data

## Previous Projects

Here are some highlights from my journey in AI and data science:

### Mapping California's "Zombie" Forests
**California Academy of Sciences** | *Nov 2024 - Jun 2025*

Applied graph ML and statistical analysis to identify indicator species for zombie forests - ecosystems that appear healthy but are actually in decline. This interdisciplinary work combined ecological research with cutting-edge machine learning to tackle climate change impacts.

### Statistical Drift Detection at Scale  
**Amazon** | *Jun 2024 - Sep 2024*

Built automatic statistical drift detection systems for data streams at massive scale. Developed algorithms that could identify when data patterns were changing across Amazon's vast infrastructure, ensuring data quality and system reliability.

### Information Networks in Renaissance Europe
**Stanford Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis** | *Feb 2024 - Jun 2024*

Used multilingual NLP and graph ML to study information networks spanning Renaissance and Post-Modern Europe. This project combined historical research with modern AI techniques to understand how ideas and information flowed across centuries of European intellectual history.

### Platform Growth through Data Science
**HighTide Intelligence** | *Jun 2023 - Aug 2023*

Applied data science techniques to drive product growth and platform development, turning user behavior insights into actionable product improvements.
